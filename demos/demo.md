What is this?
\[ y = mx + b \] {#eq:line}
Equation @eq:line describes a straight line.

More generally, the equation for a  polynomial is
\[ \begin{aligned}
     y &= a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \dots \\
     &= \sum_i a_i x^i
   \end{aligned}
\] {#eq:polynomial}

Equations {@eq:line}--{@eq:polynomial} are known to all math students.

Equations like
\[ y = A e^{-\gamma t}\cos(2\pi f t) \]
can be left unnumbered if we do not need to refer to them.  It is also possible to number equations generically without planning to refer to them; e.g.:
\[ \pi = 3.141592653589793238462643\dots \] {#eq:}
and
\[ e =   2.718281828459045235360287\dots \] {#eq:}
