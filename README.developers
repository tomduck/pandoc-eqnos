Developer Notes
===============

Contributions to this project are welcome.  In particular, full docx support
is awaiting input from a knowledgeable expert on how to structure the OOXML.


Branches
--------

The next release is developed in the `nextrelease` branch.  When ready, the
changes are merged into the `master` branch.

Version 2.0 is being temporarily developed in a separate `2.0` branch.  When
ready, it will be merged into the `nextrelease` branch.


Install Alternatives
--------------------

Installing from source may require upgrading `setuptools` by executing

    pip install --upgrade setuptools

as root (or under sudo).

1) To install from the github `master` branch use:

       $ pip install git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos.git --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

3) To install from the `nextrelease` branch on github, use

       $ pip install \
         git+https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-eqnos.git@nextrelease --user

   (to upgrade use the --upgrade flag).

4) To install from a local source distribution, `cd` into its root  and use

       pip install -e . --user

   Note that any changes made to the source will be automatically reflected
   when the filter is run (which is useful for development).


Testing
-------

Regression tests are provided in test/.  Read the README.md in that
directory for instructions.
